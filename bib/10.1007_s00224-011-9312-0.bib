  abstract = {In this note, we give a proof that several vertex ordering problems can be solved in O∗(2n) time and O∗(2n) space, or in O∗(4n) time and polynomial space. The algorithms generalize algorithms for the Travelling Salesman Problem by Held and Karp (J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 10:196--210, 1962) and Gurevich and Shelah (SIAM J. Comput. 16:486--502, 1987). We survey a number of vertex ordering problems to which the results apply.},
