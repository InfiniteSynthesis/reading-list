  abstract  = {Blockchain protocols based on variations of the longest-chain rule---whether following the proof-of-work paradigm or one of its alternatives---suffer from a fundamental latency barrier. This arises from the need to collect a sufficient number of blocks on top of a transaction-bearing block to guarantee the transaction's stability while limiting the rate at which blocks can be created in order to prevent security-threatening forks. Our main result is a black-box security-amplifying combiner based on parallel composition of m blockchains that achieves {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta (m){\$}{\$}$\Theta$(m)-fold security amplification for conflict-free transactions or, equivalently, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varTheta (m){\$}{\$}$\Theta$(m)-fold reduction in latency. Our construction breaks the latency barrier to achieve, for the first time, a ledger based purely on Nakamoto longest-chain consensus guaranteeing worst-case constant-time settlement for conflict-free transactions: settlement can be accelerated to a constant multiple of block propagation time with negligible error.},
