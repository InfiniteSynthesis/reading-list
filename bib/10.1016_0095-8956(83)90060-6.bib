  abstract = {For any tournament T on n vertices, let h(T) denote the maximum number of edges in the intersection of T with a transitive tournament on the same vertex set. Sharpening a previous result of Spencer, it is proved that, if Tn denotes the random tournament on n vertices, then, P(h(Tn) ≤ 12(2n) + 1.73n32) → 1 as n → ∞.}
